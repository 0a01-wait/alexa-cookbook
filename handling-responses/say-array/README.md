#### What you will learn

If you have an array of items you want to say to the user, use this ```sayArray()``` function to format the list with commas and a connecting word before the final item.

For example, if your list has

```
var myRequest = ['apples','oranges','strawberries'];
```

You pass in two arguments: the list array, and the connecting word.
 + the store has apples, oranges, and strawberries ```sayArray(myRequest, 'and', myResult => { ... }```
 + choose either apples, oranges, or strawberries ```sayArray(myRequest, 'or', myResult => { ... }```
