# CLI Lab
## Task 1
1. First start by [installing the ASK CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html).

 **Extra Points:** If you finish this step early, help your neighbors and if we catch you, we'll give you a small prize :)
 
 **Links:**
 [Familiarize yourself with some of the CLI features](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/ask-cli-command-reference.html).
 
 **Common Issues:**
 1. Permissions to write to `file/folder/here/'.
 
    Try elevating your user priveleges to the super user and rerunning the command. 
    It should be something like: `sudo npm install -g ask-cli`
