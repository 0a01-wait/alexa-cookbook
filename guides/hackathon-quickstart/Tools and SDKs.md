Quickstart, Tools, SDKs, and Resources
---------------------------------


######[AWS Quickstart](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/)
Quick Starts are built by AWS solutions architects and partners to help you deploy popular solutions on AWS, based on AWS best practices for security and high availability. These reference deployments implement key technologies automatically on the AWS Cloud, often with a single click and in less than an hour. You can build your test or production environment in a few steps, and start using it immediately.

######[AWS Samples](https://github.com/aws-samples)

Check out the various starter kits by searching the repo. We highlight two below:

Within the AWS Samples you will find that the Startup-Kit-template repo has an exceptionally useful set of nested Cloudformation Templates, including one to set up billing alerts for your account!

[Startup-Kit](https://github.com/aws-samples/startup-kit-templates)

If you want to use a serverless architecture there is an example serverless application that combines a RESTful API, DynamoDB, and AWS Lambda

[Startup-Serverless](https://github.com/aws-samples/startup-kit-serverless-workload)

######[AWS Labs](https://github.com/awslabs/)

The AWS Labs Github has over three hundred different projects addressing services across the AWS spectrum. One incredibly useful project for developing under a time crunch is [git-secrets] (https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets). This project prevents you from accidentally committing passwords and other secrets to a git repo. 

It's also here where you will find a wealth of serverless resources. The Serverless Application Model repo is [here](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) as well as the [Severless Express Framework](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-express).
